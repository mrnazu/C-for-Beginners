# Structures and Union
#### Structures provides a way for us to create our own data type called “ user-defined data type”
#### Assume that we have to store the details of a student, so we can use structure to store it as below:
#### Structures in C is a user-defined data type available in C that allows to combining of data items of different kinds. Structures are used to represent a record. 
#### To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than or equal to one member. 

```
 struct [structure name]
   {
       member definition;
       member definition;
       ...
       member definition;
   };
```
